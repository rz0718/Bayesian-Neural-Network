The core problem in Bayesian learning is given data $d$ and $w$, the likelihood p(d|w) and the prior probability p(w). Then, we only know $p(w|d)\sim{p(d|w)p(w)}$. We are interested at some quantities $\int{p(w|d)f(w)}dw$. Considering the very complex nature behind the function, it is very hard to find analytic solution. Then, we can only refer to numerical solution, i.e., sampling methods. Then, we have two main approaches: 1 MCMC and 2 Variational Inference 

1 MCMC:


2 Variational Inference
